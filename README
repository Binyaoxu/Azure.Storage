You can still dowload the source code and run it locally if you wish to know how things work under the covers.

Azure.Storage provide 4 basic classes, each responsible for a separate Azure storage type:

- BlobStorage --> for managing blob objects
- QueueStorage --> for managing queues
- TableStorage --> for managing table storage
- FileStorage --> for managing folders and files on Azure-attached drives
